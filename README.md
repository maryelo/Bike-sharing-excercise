# Bike-sharing-excercise



Task:

The problem with many of the biking systems is the fact that customers pay for a subscription, expecting to be able to take a bike from whatever station. On the other hand, if the bike isn’t returned within x hours (can differ from city to city), a fine is given to that customer. In addition you often see that certain stations are extra popular on certain timings while others have no customers, leading to empty or full stations. The company would like to explore the data to be able to take action on this as this results in frustrated customers.
The purpose of this assignment is to get an idea of how you handle a new dataset.  We would like to see:
1.	How you cleanse and assess the quality of the data
2.	How you (visually) explore the data
3.	How you build a model for the data, if you know we want to forecast demand*
4.	How you assess model performance
* This will require you to decide on a forecasting window (1 day, 3-day, 1 week,… )
To evaluate your work we would like to receive one or more notebooks, where you clearly show your thought and the steps performed. For the oral interview we would like you to prepare a PowerPoint presentation summarizing your most interesting findings.
